At HQ, or when task complete

- If radar is available AND radar placements not complete AND no radar request yet this turn:
    Task = place radar
        - request radar
        - set target coords
        - dig coords

- If trap is available AND no trap request yet this turn:
    Task = place trap
        - request trap
        - set target coords
        - dig coords

- Else: dig closest ore
    Task: get ore
        - set target coords
        - dig coords
        - return ore to base

- If ore available:
    Task: blind dig
        - blind_dig() - find closest undug grid
        - if ore found, task = get_ore (return to base)


TODO DAY2 PLANS:
- improved radar placement
- less risky mining/radar placement - analyze silver boss
- more aggressive trap tactics?

Idea for ore + trap tactic
- General idea for this is that we place an ore and a trap on top of the ore close to HQ so that enemy bot will prioritise the ore and go kaboom
- implementation possibility:
    -flag "execute_bait_mission=True" on a given turn and assign the mission task to a robot with ore and another robot (preferably at base)
    -then, for these two robots:
        -the one with ore will wait next to an enemy dug hole near-ish HQ (let's say around x > 4 and x < 10)
        -the other one will request trap and go to same cell as ^
    -on the same turn, insert ore and place trap at the cell (make sure to stand to the right of the cell to run away afterwards)
    -resume normal duties, turn off the bait_mission flag
